NeuralFin is still in the pre-beta stage. If any part of the website fails, it means that I am still working on it, or  have not noticed the issue yet. 
You can follow updates on Twitter [@neuralfin](https://twitter.com/neuralfin).
Do not hesitate to message @neuralfin or send an email in case you notice any bug. Email: [ranystephan+neuralfin@gmail.com](ranystephan+neuralfin@gmail.com)
