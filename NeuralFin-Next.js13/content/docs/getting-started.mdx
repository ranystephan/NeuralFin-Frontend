# Getting Started with NeuralFin

Welcome to NeuralFin! This guide will help you set up your account and start making API calls.

## Account Setup

1. Sign up for an account at [NeuralFin](https://www.neuralfin.xyz)
2. Navigate to the API Settings page
3. Generate an API key for your applications

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication. Include your API key in the header of each request:

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.neuralfin.xyz/v1/data', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
```

## Making Your First API Call

Let's make a simple API call to get stock price data:

```javascript
async function getStockData(symbol) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.neuralfin.xyz/v1/stocks/${symbol}/price`, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}

// Example usage
getStockData('AAPL').then(data => {
  console.log('Apple stock data:', data);
});
```
